- Created a Leads/Impressions Expectation report on Tableau for sellers to leverage while pitching various Zumper Products to prospective clients increasing conversion from Free to Paid Products by 3.5%
- Reduced critical airflow task failures by 40% for a crucial data pipeline by implementing a fallback plan when invalid data is inserted in the pipeline by malicious bot agents that trigger events on the platform
- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization on Looker Studio to investigate discrepancies during Google Analytics migration from UA to GA4 properties
- Leveraged dbt models to migrate data preparations tasks for data science models by loading data directly into Snowflake and AWS S3 from dbt instead of airflow to eliminate redundant computation. This decreased model retraining window by 25% due to an increase in data refresh rate
