A bar chart race built with Matplotlib for the highest run scorers in the IPL since the inception.
Used the [Python](https://github.com/hramireddy1/IPL-Runs-Visualization/blob/master/IPL_Batsmen.ipynb) BeautifulSoup web scraping library to scrape the runs scored by players in the league.
Cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis to finally build a bar chart race using matplotlib
animation.
