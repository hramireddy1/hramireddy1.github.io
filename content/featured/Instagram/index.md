Built an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/1chart_daily/) page that hosts curated intuitive charts from popular newsletters, blogs, subreddits etc. Implemented a Python script using InstaPy Python library that engages with audience that follow similar pages in order to increase the exposure of the page by sending automated follow requests.
